* Acoustic birds: an experiment in bird abundance sampling

  This project targets using acoustic sensors to detect and count
  birds.

  At the moment it makes use of the [[https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Installation-Guide][BirdNET-Pi]] interface to BirdNET.
  It adds a "reporter" component to report observations to a dedicated
  display.
